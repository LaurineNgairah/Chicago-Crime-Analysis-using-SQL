# Chicago Crime Analysis using SQL
## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing crime trends in Chicago using SQL queries. The goal is to explore crime patterns over the years, identify key trends, and generate insights that could inform policy-making and public safety efforts.

The notebook demonstrates how SQL can be used within Python to query a crime dataset, analyze data efficiently, and extract meaningful insights.

## Key Objectives
- Analyze trends in the number of arrests over the years.
- Identify patterns in specific crime types and categories.
- Investigate the number of crimes that have actually led to an arrest .
- Use SQL queries to filter, aggregate, and visualize crime-related data.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Jupyter Notebook: For running and documenting SQL queries.
- SQL: For querying the crime dataset.
- Python Libraries:
     - sqlite3: To connect and query the SQLite database.
     - pandas: For data manipulation.
     - matplotlib: For visualizing trends.

## Key Insights:
- Trends in Arrests: A sharp rise in arrests between 2011 and 2012, followed by a significant decline from 2014 to 2015.

- Crime Patterns: Aggregated and visualized data helps identify trends across different crime categories and timeframes.
